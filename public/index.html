      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

The primary focus of this project is to provide an end-to-end NLP pipeline scalable for big data analysis using rich resources in the cloud. Unlike most other NLP frameworks, ELIT supports web APIs, which makes it platform independent, so researchers can enjoy large scale computing anytime anywhere.
